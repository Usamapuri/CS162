### Student advice
At the end of the course, students are asked to provide advice to the next semester. Here is what the last semester wanted you to know!

```
Be Flexible. Set expectations right sense the beginning of the course. Enjoy the process!

The course is really fun and informative if you dedicate enough time instead of leaving everything to the last minute. Try working on your final project as soon as possible and push your teammates to do so also. Finally, have fun and be proud of how much you can do with coding and what powerful applications you can make!

Do the summer prep work or any other prerequisite that is required for this course if you want to take full advantage of this course. PreClass work is going to be long, so set aside at least 2 hours for preclass for you to understand the readings + class sessions better.

It will be helpful to take a software development course in the summer as a prep for it.
Don't shy away from asking questions in groups.
Try to work on final project in at least one of the in-semester assignments.


1) Carefully look over the syllabus to understand the bigger picture of the course
2) Choose one or two focus points to explore deeper
3) Build a clear system of doing reading/pre-class work (e.g., have a time slot for at least 3h and don't stress too much during other time)

Make friends who ask and answer questions.
Don't make a facebook group and stick to the Slack one at least for a week (if it's still hard to ask questions, just make the fb group, no judgement).
Take it easy, your pcw doesn't always have to be perfect, just try.

1. be proactive: try previewing the syllabus right at the beginning, and learn various front-end/back-end/db skills along the way;
2. regular checking with teammates to build up features # agile
3. ask questions on slack (both the class one and the team one) in time!

Allocate at least three hours before each class because you will have a hard time debugging your code. Also, make sure to read the preclass work before starting the readings.

Expect the pre-class work to be painful. The assignments are relatively straightforward, but documentation is key. Use Slack.

Start pre-class work early! The class moves fast and requires that you move fast too, leaving stuff for the last minute is not a wise choice.
Motivate your team to start the final project early
Try to adopt some of the Agile principles to your team work! Running Sprints might be really helpful.
Ask questions on Slack! You are helping others doing that too

start your final project early, and hold each other accountable.
leave enough time (2hrs+) for your prework.
if you have any projects going on, try applying the knowledge you're getting in class over there.

- START EARLY AND ASK QUESTION EARLY. Super important for preclass work
- Watch Youtube videos to get through your bug and deployment.
- It's okay to be ugly sometimes, working hard and don't skip class


- Prep well for classes, and give some time before each class
- Sometimes it will be so confusing, DW everyone else is confused as much as you are, you are not alone
- Ask for help. That's how you can actually learn and be better


1. Start readings and pcw early
2. If at all possible did some basics in dev during summer
3. start FP early


Don't be afraid to ask questions and answer questions! Schedule time for working on the final project and meeting with your group - even if it is just to check-in. Be adaptable to changes in the project and your schedule during the semester, keep on the optimistic side of realistic to succeed.

Be humble but don't put yourself down. Everyone starts somewhere (even Prof.!) so ask precise questions to figure out what you don't know and keep learning.
Trust in the process- it can be overwhelming when you don't know what you don't know to complete your app, but the course will cover most of your bases (and set you ready for reddit/stackoverflow/documentation searching).

Be super proactive when learning and communicating with your team and the professor. Learn a lot of basic software skills before the class and make sure the professor gives you the necessary materials over the summer so you can hit the ground running. Try not to pick the devops portion of the final project because not much is taught on that and you can only really do it towards the end (and it's hard to collaborate on).

- Check the sylabii in advance and make sure you have some exposure and understanding of OOP, Flask, HTML/CSS and SQL. The rest will tag along.
- Ask, ask, ask! No question is dumb... Especially ask upperclassmen for resources to be ready in advance, preferably before the course starts. Collaborate!
- Always reserve 4 - 5 hours to complete the pre-class work.

Don't be afraid of asking questions,  it is pretty much guaranteed that other people are either someone is stuck on the same thing or  were at some point, so won't judge.

1. Start things early
2. Improve your PCW after class by adding what you've learned
3. Make sure you're proactive about communicating re: final project

Start readings and assignments early. Learn how to use git properly from the beginning. Preclass work is easier than it looks like especially when you look at it a bit later on. Learn from my mistakes.

Start class preparation earlier
Practice SQL and CSS
Bes positive even when things get hard

Tell your Prof/TA/friends/teammates whether you're responsible or not. This way, you could get someone to keep you accountable or provide the external support you need.
Do PCW at least a day early!
Don't be scared of Prof. The accent is sexy not scary. Ask those questions!

You need to prepare early like one or two weeks ahead to make sure you can get your assignments done on time as well as fixing the bugs you'll face every time you're doing the pre-class work.

1. Never miss class
2. Ask questions in Slack - only works if you start early
3. Allocate a lot of time to pre-class

- Please, do your PCW as early as possible because the chances you'll get stuck are high.
- Class material is condensed and you'll learn a lot, make sure that the final project is going in parallel with the class progress.
- Communicate with team members.

Start preclass early and ask questions on slack.
Start final project early, it encourages your teammates to do so as well.
Google a lot and figure it out.

- Even if it's not your thing, i.e., either you think you don't like it or you're not good at it, stay curious and dedicate enough effort into it, then you'll realize how much you can learn and eventually enjoy learning it.
- Prof. Sterne is gold, you'll appreciate him sooner or later.

Start preparing early for classes, look for help and ask questions when you don't understand something or run into a problem.

Be flexible with the readings. If you don't understand the readings, look up online. There's a lot of resources and Stackoverflow answers that could help.

Meet early and outline a minimum project scope with your team. For the people on front-end, make sure they start working on design planning soon after this meeting and ask for input from the whole team. Make an organized structure for different files you may need and work on strong foundation first.

1. 80% of being a SWE is acting like a SWE; own your mistakes, ask for advice, and code.
2. Find proper communication / task dissemination channels at the beginning.
3. It's not you, it's your code. Separate yourself from your work and enjoy class, it's about learning not about performing.

- Start pre-class work early
- Think simple - don't overcomplicate while working (trying to implement a super complicated app while not knowing hwo to do it is soooo frustrating)
- Talk to your classmates, they'll often know out of experience and help optimize time and unnecessary effort.
